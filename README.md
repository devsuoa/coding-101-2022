# Coding 101 2022

Welcome to the Git Repository for DEVS' Coding 101 workshop for 2022! Here you will find setup instructions to be completed before the workshop, as well as examples of completed exercises to look back on after the workshop.

# Setup instructions

We will be using Node.js to run javascript taught in the workshop :D
We recommend using the online editor as the workshop is held online (so we can't help much if setup goes wrong ðŸ˜­)

There are two ways to go about doing this: 
## 1. Using a online editor (What the presenters will be doing). 

- Go to https://stackblitz.com/ and (optionally) create a account using the github login.
- Thats it! We'll go through how to create a node.js project during the workshop.

## 2. Installing software on your computer.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A text editor which we will be writing our code in.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Used to run our javascript code.
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/): Used to download packages that other people have written.

## Windows

A video of the setup process has been recorded for you if you get stuck. https://youtu.be/Yv-Se-KbFa8

### Visual Studio Code

- Download the windows installer from https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Run the installer once downloaded
- Follow the installation steps

## Node.js

- Download the windows LTS installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Run the installer once downloaded
- Follow the installation steps
- Open the windows command prompt (search for cmd)
- Verify that node is installed by running `node --version`. The node version (e.g. v12.16.0) should be returned.

## Yarn

- Download the windows installer from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable
- Run the installer once downloaded
- Follow the installation steps
- Open the windows command prompt (search for cmd)
- Verify that yarn is installed by running `yarn --version`. The yarn version (e.g.v1.22.0) should be returned.

## MacOS

A video of the setup process has been recorded for you if you get stuck. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntv5XS4NBfU

We will use homebrew to install all of the software for mac. Install homebrew by pasting the following command into the terminal (spotlight and search for terminal).

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Visual Studio Code

- Run the following command in the terminal

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

### Node.js

- Run the following command in the terminal

```
brew install node
```

- Verify that node is installed by running `node --version`. The node version (e.g. v12.16.0) should be returned.

### Yarn

- Run the following command in the terminal

```
brew install yarn
```

- Verify that yarn is installed by running `yarn --version`. The yarn version (e.g. v1.22.0) should be returned.

# Competition

1. Make Ghosts go 10 units faster every time pacman eats a pill
- Check out the ghostSpeed variable. See what happens when we change the value assigned to it.
2. Cap the ghost speed at 500.
- Check out what a if statement does.
3. When pacman eats between 5 and 10 pills he should be able to eat ghosts
- May need to create a new variable to hold how many pills pacman has eaten
- Should play the ghost `'can-eat'` animation when they can be eaten and then play `'normal'` animation otherwise.
